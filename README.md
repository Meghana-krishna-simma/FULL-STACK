# Flask Full-Stack Project

A simple but complete full-stack web application built with Flask, Bootstrap, and jQuery. The application features a user registration form, a dynamic success page, and a dashboard to display all submitted user data. It is designed to be a clean, well-structured example of a modern web application.

## Features

- **Responsive Frontend**: Built with Bootstrap 5 for a mobile-first, responsive design.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Interactive form validation using JavaScript and jQuery to provide immediate feedback.
- **Backend Logic**: A Flask backend to handle form submissions and serve pages.
- **In-Memory Data Storage**: Temporarily stores user submissions in memory (no database required for this simple version).
- **Admin Dashboard**: A simple dashboard to view a list of all registered users.
- **Polished UI/UX**: Features a fixed background, custom color theme, animated success page, and UI icons for an enhanced user experience.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For custom styling, animations, and the background.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Core CSS framework for layout, components, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (jQuery)**: For DOM manipulation and client-side form validation.
- **Bootstrap Icons**: For clean and modern UI icons.

### Backend
- **Python 3**: The core programming language.
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for routing and request handling.
- **Jinja2**: A templating engine used by Flask to render dynamic HTML.

### Development Tools
- **Git**: For version control.
- **pip**: For managing Python packages.
- **Virtual Environments**: To isolate project dependencies.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these detailed instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Python 3**: You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip**: Python's package installer, which typically comes with Python 3.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### 2. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

After cloning, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

### 3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is a best practice to create a virtual environment to keep the project's dependencies isolated from your global Python installation.

**On Windows:**
```bash
# Create the virtual environment (named 'venv')
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS and Linux:**
```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate
```

After activation, you will see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

### 4. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment active, install all the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Flask Application

Now you are ready to start the Flask development server.

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start, and you will see output indicating that it is running. By default, the application will be available at:

**http://127.0.0.1:5000**
